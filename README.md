# Website Factory — Base Template

This is the scaffold used by the Website Factory pipeline to generate client websites.

## What's included

- **Astro** — Static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework
- **Decap CMS** — Git-based content management at `/admin/`
- **GitHub Actions** — Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages on every commit

## How it works

1. The n8n pipeline clones this template
2. Injects business content into `content/site.json`
3. Injects Decap CMS config into `public/admin/config.yml`
4. Cursor CLI generates all pages and components based on an AI design mockup
5. The code is pushed to a new GitHub repo
6. GitHub Actions builds and deploys to GitHub Pages

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Content editing

After deployment, visit `https://your-site.github.io/your-repo/admin/` to edit content
via the Decap CMS admin interface. Changes are committed directly to GitHub and trigger
an automatic rebuild.
